### SPORTSAPI

## Idea
I go to Reddit to see if there's any sports stuff in it, but none. So I decided to make a **backend only** for this matter

## Tech Stack
I use FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy for this. The reason I chose FastAPI because the syntax is simple, PostgreSQL as I'm
comfortable with using SQL at that time, and SQLAlchemy as I found out SQLAlchemy is like the Git of Database so I decided to 
give it a try, and it saved me when I accidentally add a new table for the app LOL.
